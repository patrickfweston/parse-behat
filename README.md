# Parse
A simple piece of Javascript to create markup tests from a section of markup code.

## How to Use
* The Behat region : This is the name of the region that the test should look for markup in. This region should be defined in your behat.yml file
* Markup : The copy and pasted markup to test.

Once you enter these items, simply click "Parse". Your tests are printed below.

## Notes
Parse ignores SVGs and HTML comments
